# Custom UMLS concept for Belgium

This repo takes concepts from UMLS, the Belgian SnomedCT extension and Belgian drug names to generate custom concept tables to be used in biomedical entity linking tasks on (Belgian) French medical corpus.
See the concept_table_generation.ipynb for the whole process.
